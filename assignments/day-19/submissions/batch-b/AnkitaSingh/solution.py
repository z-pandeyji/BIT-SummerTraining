# 1. The generator can only use word transitions that already
#    exist in the training text. It cannot invent new knowledge.
#
# 2. The output may become repetitive or grammatically incorrect
#    because it only looks at one previous word instead of the
#    full sentence context.
#
# 3. A one-word transition model simply chooses the next word
#    based on previous observations. A transformer uses attention
#    mechanisms to understand relationships between many words
#    across the entire context, making it much more powerful.
